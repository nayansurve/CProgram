The given program calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. It repeatedly subtracts the smaller of the two numbers from the larger one until they become equal, and the final value of `n` will be the GCD.

Let's see the program in action with an example:

Suppose you input `x = 48` and `y = 18`.

1. Initially, `m = 48` and `n = 18`.

2. In the first iteration of the `while` loop:
   - `m` is greater than `n`, so it subtracts `n` from `m`: `m = 48 - 18 = 30`.

3. In the second iteration of the `while` loop:
   - `m` is still greater than `n`, so it subtracts `n` from `m` again: `m = 30 - 18 = 12`.

4. In the third iteration of the `while` loop:
   - `m` is still greater than `n`, so it subtracts `n` from `m` once more: `m = 12 - 18`. Now, `m` is negative.

5. In the fourth iteration of the `while` loop:
   - Since `m` is negative, the `else` branch executes, and it subtracts `m` from `n`: `n = 18 - (-12) = 18 + 12 = 30`.

6. In the fifth iteration of the `while` loop:
   - `m` is greater than `n`, so it subtracts `n` from `m`: `m = 30 - 30 = 0`.

7. Now, `m` is equal to `n`, so the `while` loop exits.

8. It prints the value of `n`, which is `0`, using `printf`.

So, the output of the program for the input values `x = 48` and `y = 18` is `0`, which is the GCD of `48` and `18`.



main()
{
int x, y, m, n;
scanf ("%d %d", &x, &y);
/* x > 0 and y > 0 */
m = x; n = y;
while (m != n)
{
	if(m>n)
		m = m - n;
	else
		n = n - m;
}
printf("%d", n);
}
