Certainly! Here's an algorithmic representation of the given C code:

**Algorithm for Arithmetic Calculator**

1. Start

2. Declare variables:
   - `choice` (integer) for storing the user's choice of operation.
   - `num1` and `num2` (doubles) for storing the two input numbers.
   - `result` (double) for storing the result of the operation.

3. Display a menu with options:
   - "Choose an option:"
   - "1. Add"
   - "2. Subtract"
   - "3. Multiply"
   - "4. Divide"

4. Read the user's choice into the `choice` variable using `scanf`.

5. Prompt the user to enter two numbers and read them into the `num1` and `num2` variables using `scanf`.

6. Use a `switch` statement to perform the selected arithmetic operation based on the value of `choice`:
   - Case 1:
     - Add `num1` and `num2` and store the result in `result`.
     - Display the result.
     - Break out of the `switch` statement.
   - Case 2:
     - Subtract `num2` from `num1` and store the result in `result`.
     - Display the result.
     - Break out of the `switch` statement.
   - Case 3:
     - Multiply `num1` and `num2` and store the result in `result`.
     - Display the result.
     - Break out of the `switch` statement.
   - Case 4:
     - Check if `num2` is equal to zero:
       - If yes, display an error message: "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
       - If no, divide `num1` by `num2` and store the result in `result`.
       - Display the result.
     - Break out of the `switch` statement.
   - Default:
     - Display "Invalid choice" if the user's choice is not 1, 2, 3, or 4.

7. End

This algorithm outlines the steps the program takes to provide a basic arithmetic calculator based on the user




*OUTPUT:
Choose an option:
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide





Here's an algorithmic representation of the C program you provided, which determines whether a user-entered integer is even or odd using the `if-else` statement:

**Algorithm for Determining Whether a Number is Even or Odd**

1. Start

2. Declare an integer variable `number`.

3. Display a message: "Enter an integer."

4. Read an integer input from the user and store it in the `number` variable using `scanf`.

5. Check if the number is even or odd using the `if-else` statement:
   - If `number % 2` is equal to 0 (i.e., the remainder of `number` divided by 2 is 0):
     - Display "`number` is even."
   - Else:
     - Display "`number` is odd."

6. End

This algorithm describes the steps performed by the given C program to determine whether an entered integer is even or odd and then displays the result accordingly.



*OUTPUT:

Enter an integer: 12
12 is even.
