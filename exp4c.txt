Here's an algorithmic representation of the given C code for finding the largest of three numbers:

**Algorithm for Finding the Largest of Three Numbers**

1. Start

2. Declare three variables:
   - `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` (doubles) for storing the three numbers.

3. Display a message: "Enter three numbers."

4. Read three numbers (`num1`, `num2`, and `num3`) from the user using `scanf`.

5. Check for the largest number using `if-else` statements:
   - If `num1` is greater than or equal to both `num2` and `num3`:
     - Display "The largest number is `num1`."
   - Else, if `num2` is greater than or equal to both `num1` and `num3`:
     - Display "The largest number is `num2`."
   - Otherwise:
     - Display "The largest number is `num3`."

6. End

This algorithm describes the steps performed by the given C code to find and display the largest of three numbers entered by the user



*OUTPUT:
Enter three numbers:
5 10 7
The largest number is 10.
