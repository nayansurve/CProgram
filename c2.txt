#include <stdio.h> 
main() 
{ 
	int i; 
	int *pi = &i; 
	scanf("%d", pi); 
	printf("%d\n", i+5); 
} 



The given C program reads an integer from the user using `scanf` through a pointer `pi` and then prints the value of `i` incremented by 5.

Here's how the program works:

1. `int i;` declares an integer variable `i`.

2. `int *pi = &i;` declares a pointer to an integer `pi` and assigns the address of `i` to it. This means that `pi` points to the same memory location as `i`.

3. `scanf("%d", pi);` reads an integer from the user and stores it in the memory location pointed to by `pi`, which is the same as `i`.

4. `printf("%d\n", i+5);` prints the value of `i + 5`. Since `i` has been modified by `scanf`, it will print `i + 5` where `i` is the value entered by the user.

So, if you enter, for example, the integer `10` when prompted, the program will print:

```
15
```

It takes the value you entered (`10`), adds `5` to it, and prints the result (`15`).
