Here's an algorithmic representation of the given C code for calculating the factorial of a positive integer using `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops:

**Algorithm for Calculating Factorial**

1. Start

2. Declare variables:
   - `number` (integer) for storing the positive integer input.
   - `factorial` (integer) for storing the factorial of the input number, initialized to 1.

3. Display a message: "Enter a positive integer."

4. Read the positive integer input from the user and store it in the `number` variable using `scanf`.

5. Check if `number` is less than 0:
   - If yes, display an error message: "Error: Factorial is not defined for negative numbers."
   - Exit the program with an error code (return 1).

6. Initialize a loop control variable `i` to 1.

7. Calculate the factorial using a `while` loop:
   - Initialize `factorial` to 1.
   - While `i` is less than or equal to `number`:
     - Multiply `factorial` by `i`.
     - Increment `i` by 1.

8. Display the result of the factorial calculation using a `while` loop:
   - Display "Factorial using while loop: `number`! = `factorial`."

9. Reset `factorial` to 1 for the next calculation.

10. Calculate the factorial using a `do-while` loop:
    - Initialize `factorial` to 1.
    - Initialize `i` to 1.
    - Do the following while `i` is less than or equal to `number`:
      - Multiply `factorial` by `i`.
      - Increment `i` by 1.

11. Display the result of the factorial calculation using a `do-while` loop:
    - Display "Factorial using do-while loop: `number`! = `factorial`."

12. Reset `factorial` to 1 for the next calculation.

13. Calculate the factorial using a `for` loop:
    - Initialize `factorial` to 1.
    - Use a `for` loop with the loop control variable `i` initialized to 1 and the loop condition `i` less than or equal to `number`:
      - Multiply `factorial` by `i`.

14. Display the result of the factorial calculation using a `for` loop:
    - Display "Factorial using for loop: `number`! = `factorial`."

15. End

This algorithm describes the steps performed by the given C code to calculate and display the factorial of a positive integer using different loop constructs


*OUTPUT:

Factorial using while loop: 5! = 120.

Factorial using do-while loop: 5! = 120.

Factorial using for loop: 5! = 120.
